## The `?` Operator

The `?` operator is used to propagate errors in functions that return a Result type. It is a shorthand for handling Result and Option types in a way that simplifies error handling and makes the code more readable.

**Usage of `?`**

When you use the `?` operator on a `Result` or `Option` value, it does the following:

- If the value is `Ok(T)` or `Some(T)`, it unwraps the value and continues execution.
- If the value is `Err(E)` or `None`, it returns early from the function with the error.

Here is an example:

```rust
fn process_file(path: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    let mut file = std::fs::File::open(path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    println!("File contents: {}", contents);
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example:

- `File::open(path)?` attempts to open the file. If it fails, it returns the error immediately.
- `file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?` attempts to read the file contents. If it fails, it returns the error immediately.
- If both operations succeed, it prints the contents and returns `Ok(())`.

## `Ok(())`

`Ok(())` is a Result type where the success value is a unit type `()`. This is often used to indicate that a function has completed successfully without returning any specific value.

**Meaning of `Ok(())`**

- `Ok`: Indicates that the operation was successful.
- `()`: The unit type, which represents an empty tuple. It is used when there is no meaningful value to return.

In the context of the process_file function above, `Ok(())` indicates that the function has completed successfully and there are no errors.

**Example**

Here is a complete example to illustrate the usage of `?` and `Ok(())`:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_file_contents(path: &str) -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

fn main() {
    match read_file_contents("example.txt") {
        Ok(contents) => println!("File contents: {}", contents),
        Err(e) => println!("Failed to read file: {}", e),
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `File::open(path)?` and `file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?` use the `?` operator to propagate errors.
- If both operations succeed, `Ok(contents)` is returned.
- In the main function, the result is handled using a match statement.

## Summary

The `?` operator is used to propagate errors in functions that return a `Result` or `Option` type.
`Ok(())` is a Result type indicating successful completion without returning any specific value.
Using `?` and `Ok(())` helps make error handling in Rust more concise and readable.
