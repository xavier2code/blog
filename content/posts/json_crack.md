## JSON Crack: An Innovative Open-Source Data Visualization Tool

**JSON Crack** is a powerful, open-source tool designed to visualize JSON data and other common data formats (such as YAML, XML, CSV, and TOML) into interactive graphs and trees. This tool aims to simplify the process of exploring, formatting, and validating JSON data, making it easier for developers and data analysts to work with complex data structures.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Format Support**: JSON Crack supports a wide range of data formats, including JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, and TOML.
2. **Interactive Graphs**: Convert data into interactive graphs or trees, allowing users to explore complex data structures visually.
3. **Dark Mode: Offers** a dark mode option to reduce eye strain during extended use.
4. **Data Conversion**: Seamlessly transform data between different formats (e.g., JSON to CSV, XML to JSON) for easy sharing and interoperability.
5. **Code Generation**: Generate TypeScript interfaces, Golang structs, and JSON Schema from your data.
6. **Advanced Tools**: Includes features like JWT decoding, data randomization, and execution of jq or JSON path queries.
7. **Export Options**: Export visualizations as images in formats like PNG, JPEG, or SVG for sharing and reporting.
8. **Privacy**: All data processing is done locally, ensuring that no data is stored on external servers.
