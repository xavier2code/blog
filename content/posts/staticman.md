## What is Staticman

> Staticman is an Open Source application which enables static websites to accept dynamic content submissions, including things like comments. A simple REST API is exposed which accepts content and publishes it to the site. While many comment solutions for static websites require embedding arbitrary JavaScript (and often privacy invading trackers), Staticman works with a simple REST form submission. This means it can even work with bare HTML pages!
