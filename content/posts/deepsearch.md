"Open Deep Research" is an open-source alternative to OpenAI's Deep Research tool. It aims to generate AI-powered reports from web search results with precision and efficiency. Here are some key points about Open Deep Research:

## What is Open Deep Research?

- **Definition**: Open Deep Research is an open-source tool designed to automate the process of generating detailed reports based on web search results. It leverages AI to analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources.
- **Functionality**: It can autonomously search the web, scroll through pages, manipulate files, and even perform calculations with data.

## How Does It Work?

- **Search Results Retrieval**: The tool uses the Bing Search API to fetch comprehensive search results for a given query.
- **Content Extraction**: It processes the contents of selected search results using JinaAI to ensure accurate and relevant information.
- **Report Generation**: The extracted information is then used to generate a detailed report using an AI model of your choice (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Google Gemini, etc.).

## Features

- **Multi-Platform AI Support**: Supports multiple AI platforms and models, offering flexibility in choosing the right AI model for specific research needs.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the tool by selecting their preferred AI model, customizing prompts, updating rate limits, and configuring the number of results fetched and selected.
- **Export Options**: Reports can be exported in multiple formats, including PDF, Word, and plain text.
- **Knowledge Base**: Users can save and access their generated reports in a personal knowledge base for future reference.

## Comparison with OpenAI's Deep Research

- **Performance**: Open Deep Research achieves a score of 54% on the GAIA benchmark, compared to OpenAI's Deep Research, which scores 67.36%.
- **Accessibility**: While OpenAI's Deep Research is currently available only to ChatGPT Pro users, Open Deep Research is open-source and accessible to anyone.

## Current Limitations

- **Model Dependency**: Open Deep Research lacks access to OpenAI's proprietary o3 model, which is a key component of OpenAI's Deep Research. This limits its performance in certain complex tasks.
- **Usability Issues**: During initial public demos, Open Deep Research faced issues with heavy load and reliability.

## Future Development

- **Improvement Commitment**: The development team is committed to improving the tool and has made the source code available on GitHub for community feedback and contributions.

Open Deep Research represents an effort to democratize access to advanced research tools by providing an open-source alternative to proprietary solutions.
