The error "linker ld-prime not found" suggests that the linker ld-prime is not available or not correctly specified in your Rust project configuration. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. Verify Xcode Installation

Ensure that you have Xcode 15 or later installed, as ld-prime is included with Xcode 15. You can check the installed version of Xcode by running:

```sh
xcodebuild -version

```

2. Specify the Correct Linker Path

The ld-prime linker might not be directly accessible by name. You need to specify the full path to the linker. You can find the path to ld-prime by running:

```sh
xcrun --find ld

```

This command will output the path to the linker, which might be something like `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/ld`.

3. Update Cargo Configuration

Update your Cargo configuration to use the full path to ld-prime. You can do this by editing the .cargo/config.toml file in your project directory:

```toml
[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
linker = "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/ld"
```

Replace the path with the one you obtained from the xcrun --find ld command.

4. Verify the Configuration

After updating the configuration, try building your project again:

```sh
cargo build
```

5. Fallback to ld64 if Necessary

If you continue to encounter issues with ld-prime, you can revert to using the older ld64 linker as a temporary workaround. Update your .cargo/config.toml to use ld64:

```toml
[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
linker = "ld64"
```

### Additional Tips

- Clean Build: Sometimes, a clean build can resolve unexpected issues. Run the following command to clean the build directory:

```sh
cargo clean
```

- Check for Updates: Ensure that your Rust toolchain and Xcode are up to date. You can update Rust using rustup:

```sh
rustup update
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "linker ld-prime not found" error and configure your Rust project to use the appropriate linker on macOS with Xcode 15.
